# Discord.js v14 Moderation Bot
<h5>The advanced Discord Moderation bot built with discord.js v14.</h5>

<h2>Discord.js v14 Moderation Bot</h2>
The best Discord Moderation bot that I have ever created, all made with discord.js version 14 and discord.js-v14-helper. This project requires MongoDB to connect to the database, so make sure to get a MongoDB URI! You can create many commands as you want to improve your bot, just make sure that your bot won't go crazy!

#### Warning
This project is made for single guild, and not a multi-guild one. You can develop it a little further and turn it into multiple servers.

# Setup the project

## Dependencies installation:
Firstly, install `package-lock.json` file:
```shell
npm init -y
```

Then install the required dependencies:

```shell
npm i discord.js mongoose
```

## Start the project
The setup for now is for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) users only. If you are a repl.it user and non-beginner programmer, you can read the setup below but you have to edit the Environment processing for MongoDB and the bot token.
- I. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- II. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- III. Open command propmt and then type `node -v` and make sure that you have installed node.js version **16.9.0** or above.
- IV. [Download the project](https://github.com/justthendra/discord.js-v14-moderation-template) and extract the folder from .zip folder to a normal folder.
- V. Open the folder on a new VSCode tab.
- VI. Go to `src/config.json` because it is also a configuration file.
- VII. Open terminal and then type `node .\src\bot.js` or `node .`.
- VIII. Enjoy.

## Hosting
Due to repl.it rate-limits problems and unsecurities, I always recommend using a VDS.
